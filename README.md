Using R, I created a Shiny web app to display [the locations of breweries, wineries, and vineyards within the Willamette River Basin](https://jhiester.shinyapps.io/wrb_bwv/) for a local non-profit organization. Their goal was to reach out to these entities and engage them on sustainable agriculturural practices. The data were scraped from various sources using third party tools.
