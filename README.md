Using R, I scraped data from various sources on the web to compile a [map of breweries, wineries, and vineyards in the Willamette River Basin](https://jhiester.shinyapps.io/wrb_bwv/) for a local non-profit organization. Their goal was to reach out to these entities and engage them on sustainable agriculturural practices.
